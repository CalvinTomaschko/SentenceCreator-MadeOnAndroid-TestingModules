# Motivation

Get used to working on mobile, memorize some keyboard shortcuts, and use modules to break up the code, were all goals for this project. There was also the goal of have fun while on long bus or train rides over the holidays. 


### App goal

Have a list of different parts of a sentence, take random selections from each list, and then make a hopefully funny or odd sentence.
